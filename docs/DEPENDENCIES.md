# Dependencies

All dependencies are installed automatically by `scripts/install.sh`. This document lists them for reference.

## External Services (Optional)

These are separate projects that can be self-hosted or used as public services:

| Service | Purpose | Options |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **[ntfy](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy)** | Push notifications to mobile | Use public `ntfy.sh` or self-host |
| **[bore](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore)** | TCP tunneling for remote access | Self-host server + local client |

### ntfy Setup

For push notifications, you have two options:

**Option A: Public ntfy.sh (easiest)**
- No setup required
- Set `NtfyUrl: "https://ntfy.sh"` in config
- Pick a unique topic name

**Option B: Self-hosted ntfy**
```bash
# Install ntfy server
curl -sSL https://install.ntfy.sh | sh

# Or via Docker
docker run -p 8085:80 binwiederhier/ntfy serve
```

### bore Setup (for remote access)

If you want to access the viewer from outside your network:

```bash
# Install bore client (on arlo-base)
cargo install bore-cli

# On your public server, run bore server
bore server --min-port 8080 --max-port 8090

# bore tunnels are configured in install.conf
```

## System Packages (apt)

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `hostapd` | WiFi access point daemon (WPS pairing) |
| `dnsmasq-base` | DHCP for the camera network, run as the private `arlo-dhcp.service` (DNS disabled, `port=0`). The `dnsmasq` system service is not needed |
| `iw`, `rfkill`, `iproute2` | Radio control, connectivity checks, AP address |
| `psmisc` | `fuser`, used by the viewer unit to free port 3003 |
| `rsync`, `openssl`, `curl`, `logrotate` | Installer deploys and secrets, `arlo-status` |
| `python3-venv`, `python3-dev`, `build-essential` | Virtualenv; some pinned pip packages build from source |
| `ffmpeg` | Thumbnails from finished recordings (not used for RTSP) |
| `nodejs`, `npm` | arlo-viewer. The distro version is fine (tested with Node 12 and 16) |
| `gstreamer1.0-tools` | `gst-launch-1.0`, used for motion recording |
| `gstreamer1.0-plugins-base` | Core GStreamer plugins |
| `gstreamer1.0-plugins-good` | `rtspsrc`, `rtph264depay`, `matroskamux` |
| `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad` | `h264parse`, `h265parse`, HLS |
| `python3-gst-1.0` | Python bindings for live-stream helper (runs on system python3) |

The installer no longer installs `netfilter-persistent`/`iptables-persistent`
and does not write firewall rules.

### Optional

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `bore` | TCP tunnel for remote access (install via cargo) |

## Node.js Packages (npm)

Located in `src/arlo-viewer/package.json`:

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `express` | ^4.18.2 | Web server framework |
| `js-yaml` | ^4.1.1 | YAML parsing for config |

## Why GStreamer Instead of FFmpeg?

Both are installed, but GStreamer is used for live streaming because:

- **FFmpeg** sends RTCP keep-alive packets every 10 seconds (hardcoded)
- **Arlo cameras** require RTCP every 5 seconds or they stop streaming
- **GStreamer** correctly sends RTCP at 5-second intervals

FFmpeg is still used for thumbnail generation from recorded videos.

## Version Notes

The Python dependencies use older versions for compatibility with the original arlo-cam-api fork. Consider updating for security patches, but test thoroughly as Flask 1.x → 2.x has breaking changes.

## Credits / Based On

| Project | Author | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| [arlo-cam-api](https://github.com/Meatballs1/arlo-cam-api) | Meatballs1 | Original Arlo camera protocol implementation |
| [ntfy](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) | binwiederhier | Push notification server |
| [bore](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore) | ekzhang | TCP tunnel for remote access |

The `arlo-cam-api` project reverse-engineered the Arlo camera protocol and provided the foundation for this base station replacement. This project extends it with:
- GStreamer-based live streaming (fixes RTCP timing issues)
- Web-based recording viewer
- ntfy push notifications with thumbnails
- Improved WiFi hardware compatibility documentation
